0x19. Postmortem



Any software system will eventually fail, and that failure can come stem from a wide range of possible factors: bugs, traffic spikes, security issues, hardware failures, natural disasters, human error… Failing is normal and failing is actually a great opportunity to learn and improve. Any great Software Engineer must learn from his/her mistakes to make sure that they won’t happen again. Failing is fine, but failing twice because of the same issue is not.

A postmortem is a tool widely used in the tech industry. After any outage, the team(s) in charge of the system will write a summary that has 2 main goals:

To provide the rest of the company’s employees easy access to information detailing the cause of the outage. Often outages can have a huge impact on a company, so managers and executives have to understand what happened and how it will impact their work.
And to ensure that the root cause(s) of the outage has been discovered and that measures are taken to make sure it will be fixed.

What is an Incident Postmortem?


Using one of the web stack debugging project issue or an outage you have personally face, write a postmortem. Most of you will never have faced an outage, so just get creative and invent your own :)

Requirements:

Issue Summary (that is often what executives will read) must contain:
duration of the outage with start and end times (including timezone)
what was the impact (what service was down/slow? What were user experiencing? How many % of the users were affected?)
what was the root cause
Timeline (format bullet point, format: time - keep it short, 1 or 2 sentences) must contain:

when was the issue detected
how was the issue detected (monitoring alert, an engineer noticed something, a customer complained…)
actions taken (what parts of the system were investigated, what were the assumption on the root cause of the issue)
misleading investigation/debugging paths that were taken
which team/individuals was the incident escalated to
how the incident was resolved
Root cause and resolution must contain:

explain in detail what was causing the issue
explain in detail how the issue was fixed
Corrective and preventative measures must contain:

what are the things that can be improved/fixed (broadly speaking)
a list of tasks to address the issue (be very specific, like a TODO, example: patch Nginx server, add monitoring on server memory…)
Be brief and straight to the point, between 400 to 600 words

While postmortem format can vary, stick to this one so that you can get properly reviewed by your peers.


0x17. Web stack debugging #3


When debugging, sometimes logs are not enough. Either because the software is breaking in a way that was not expected and the error is not being logged, or because logs are not providing enough information. In this case, you will need to go down the stack, the good news is that this is something Holberton students can do :)

Wordpress is a very popular tool, it allows you to run blogs, portfolios, e-commerce and company websites… It actually powers 26% of the web, so there is a fair chance that you will end up working with it at some point in your career.

Wordpress is usually run on LAMP (Linux, Apache, MySQL, and PHP), which is a very widely used set of tools.

The web stack you are debugging today is a Wordpress website running on a LAMP stack.
